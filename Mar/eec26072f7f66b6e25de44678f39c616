The Makhado police are asking the public’s assistance in locating a 29-year-old Louis Trichardt man who went missing about two weeks ago. Mr Clément Rodrigues Symons, a resident of Songozwi Street in Louis Trichardt, went missing on Sunday, 28 February. Symons allegedly left his home with a friend to travel to Buysdorp near Vivo at around 15:00. He never arrived at his destination and he has since disappeared. Family members tried to reach him through his cellphone, but it goes directly to voicemail. The police also conducted search operations in the surrounding areas but without success. According to the police, Symons was last seen wearing a blue long-sleeve T-shirt, navy blue denim pants and blue sneakers. They urged anyone with information that can assist the police in finding the missing man to contact Warrant Officer Johannes Hlongwane on 072 470 5588 or 015 519 4300 or by phoning the crime stop number 0860010111.
