A number of the Department of Employment and Labour’s offices in Limpopo will be closed until 14 January because officials tested positive for Covid-19. Provincial spokesperson for the department Lerato Mashamba said that, as part of health and safety protocols, the offices were put through the decontamination process to ensure the safety of staff and clients who visited these offices. Those who came into contact with the affected officials had gone into isolation. The offices that had to be closed are Malamulele, Modimolle, Polokwane and Tzaneen. Provincial Chief Inspector Phaswane Tladi said that most of the department’s offices would close because of the rising number of daily infections. “This comes in the wake of large numbers of clients who have lost their source of income during the pandemic and visit our offices for relief [funds]. We urge our clients to be patient during this difficult period, as the closure will temporarily affect services rendered by the department,” Tladi said. Where possible, the department urges clients to utilise online services at www.labour.gov.za or, alternatively, visit other offices nearest to closed centres. “We understand that Limpopo is a rural province, but I want to implore those who have access to the Internet to utilise it. Moreover, call on the younger generation to assist their parents or family members to apply for their benefits online,” Tladi said. Tladi pointed out that this time was difficult for the entire nation, but that the health and safety of staff and clients remained a priority. He called on all citizens not to let their guard down and to continue to adhere to all Covid-19 regulations. Members of the community were also reminded that the Thohoyandou office is still closed, and clients are advised to use alternative labour centres at Makhado. The department apologised profusely for the inconvenience caused.
