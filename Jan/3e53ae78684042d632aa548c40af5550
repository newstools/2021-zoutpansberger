Eskom announced on Monday that it would be suspending its planned load shedding schedule for the week after the return of some of its generators to service saw an improvement in their generation capacity. “Over the past 24 hours Eskom teams have successfully returned two generation units ach at Kusile, Kriel and one at Tutuka Power Stations to service. Another two generations units are expected to return to service tomorrow [today] while emergency generation reserves have also adequately recovered,” said Eskom in a statement. Eskom said they would like the thank the people of South Africa for their patience and understanding during the load shedding. “While the supply has improved at this point, Eskom would like to request the public to continue using electricity sparingly as the system is vulnerable and unpredictable. As Eskom has regularly stated, the risk of load shedding remains elevated while we conduct increased reliability maintenance,” said Eskom. Currently, said Eskom, they have 4 920MW on planned maintenance, while another 13 897MW of capacity is unavailable due to unplanned maintenance, breakdowns and outage delays. “Eskom teams are hard at work returning as much of this capacity to service as soon as possible,” said Eskom.
