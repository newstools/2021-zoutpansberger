It is not certain how long residents of Louis Trichardt and Tshikota will have to wait until the water supply is restored again. Water supply to Louis Trichardt and surrounds from the Albasini Dam was interrupted on Tuesday when the main supply line suffered a major pipe burst near the farm Beja. This resulted in the water treatment plant at the Albasini Dam being shut down. Since then, technicians from the Vhembe District Municipality (VDM) worked tirelessly to restore the water supply. By early this morning, the pipe burst was fixed and the VDM resumed pumping. The fix was, however, short-lived. “As soon as they started pumping, the pipeline burst again so they are still busy fixing it now,” said VDM spokesperson Mr Moses Shibambu. He was unable to give an indication of when residents can expect water back in their taps, and again apologise for any inconvenience caused.
